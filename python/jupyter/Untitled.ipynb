      "secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.\n",
      "The English have not understood and cannot understand the\n",

      "desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And\n",
      "what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has\n",
